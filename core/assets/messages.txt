Thanks! I'm glad it didn't get you, What's it you ask, why it is your ex wife Carol, she's been hunting you in your crew for a while, she didn't take the divorce well
Thanks!
Thanks!

Thanks!
Thanks!
Thanks!
Thanks! You know this is all your fault though right? If it wasn't for you, it would be terrorizing the seas
Thanks! You know, I saw it before she was mad once, it wasn't that scary, those were very different days
Thanks! Wait, you're telling me you have no recollection of what it is? You must have hit your head or something.
Thanks! How did you manage to avoid it? Well doesn't matter, we should get going before it comes back.
Thanks! You know, I'm pretty sure it's the scariest thing I've ever seen, like the size of the fangs on it.
Thanks! I'm surprised to see you still here, I thought it would have gotten you after all we did.
Thanks! I'm so glad you found me before it did, I was really starting to worry.
Thanks! Remember to be careful, sailing into the shore too fast will wreck your ship, and without a ship you'll be really vulnerable to it.
Thanks! I heard there are undiscovered shipwrecks in the deep water, just imagine the gold waiting if we sail through there. I guess it's sunk a lot of ships
Thanks! I was sailing through the shallow water being chased by it and I didn't realize there were rocks, I guess you got to be careful while sailing
